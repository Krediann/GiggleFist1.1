You meet a Devil sitting on a hickory stump and he said:
Devil:"Boy let me tell you what, I guess you didn't know it I'm a fiddle player too and if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you.
Now I'm sure you play pretty good fiddle boy, but give the devil his due, I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul, 'cause I think I'm better than you"
