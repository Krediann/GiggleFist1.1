Bob briefs you on the Kobold's alleged location:
A cavern some ways off to the north of the town.
The road leading there has been a favourite ambush spot with brigands lately
and Bob reminds you with a fatherly tone "Keep your wits about you".


You gather your belongings and step out of the Wick's End and notice a merchant on the other side of the road, walking up, you notice that the merchant has good wares for an adventurer like you:
[A]: Claw-weapons for your fist (increases your ATK by 3).
[B]: Healing Herbs (Increases your HP by 5).
[C]: an Authentic Stradivarius (This beautiful hand-crafted instrument is sure to be helpful in one way or another.)

Looking through your coinpurse you realise that you only have the coin for one of these items, which one do you choose?

Press A for Claw-weapons
Press B for Healing Herbs
Press C for an Authentic Stradivarius
Press N for nothing
