You look down the road and you hear a person in weird looking clothing walk down at you, he stops you and tells you she's an artiste.
The Artiste looks you up and down and tells you he's heard of the mighty Gigglefist's adventures and asks you where you're going next.
Despite how odd she looks and how he just knows you with a glance, you decide to tell him you're on your way to the Kobold's Cavern.

He let's out a brief haughty laughter (Even though you know you didn't say anything funny). Her expression goes back to a deadpan, until he looks at you amused:
Artiste:"Oh that is the objective of this life? So be it, will you accept my boon?"

Type 'A' to accept
Type 'D' to decline
