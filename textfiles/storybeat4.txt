After this you continue you your way down this long and lonesome road.
Deciding to camp out for the night, you ponder upon today's events and feel hopeful for your future

Eating your rations and extinguishing the campfire you lay down to rest for the night in your bedroll.

As sleep takes you and the clear night sky fades away, you see a distant landscape...

A shore, with sand made of stardust and an ocean of stars.

The sandman has brought you a restful sleep.


Good night, GiggleFist
