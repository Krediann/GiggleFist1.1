You find a roadside merchant with a lot of cheap goods, some helpful, some maybe not so much:
[A]: a Teddybear (Sure, this makes you feel better, offers no stats).
[B]: a Strengthening potion (You don't feel that different, ATK +1).
[C]: a Healing shroom (You are fairly sure that's just psychedelics, but guess it toughens up your mind, HP +2)
[D]: a Hearthstone

Type A to buy the Teddybear
Type B to buy the Strenghtening potion
Type C to buy the Healing shroom
Type D to buy the Hearthstone
